# Hi, I'm Catherine 

I'm a *Project Manager Finance* working mostly with Excel. I'm currently learning __Python__ and brushing up my skills in statistics, probability, and linear algebra because... 
I'm reconverting to âœ¨ _**Data Science**_ âœ¨  

I have enrolled in a Bootcamp by [HyperionDev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/) and should make my firsts steps in the world of Data science by the end of June 2024.  

## Where to find me ðŸ‘€
My [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherineschalbroeck/) is usually the best place to start.

> [!NOTE]
> I don't have much to showcase for now but **I will update my profile as I progress in my learning.**
