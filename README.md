# Hi, I'm Catherine 

I'm a junior *Data Scientist* who recently graduated from [HyperionDev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/)'s Data Science Skill Bootcamp. I have advanced skills in **Data Analysis** with Excel (using complex formulas, setting up responsive dashboards, and building up macros), and have recently learned Python with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.
